This files show the process to have both the servers running in same machine:

Go to "/etc/nginx/sites-available"
and then modify the host file which should listen to a different port.
look for the conf file or default file.

In the file change listen: 80 to the port you want to listen to change.

And reload the service: service nginx reload
